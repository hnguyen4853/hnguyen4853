# Hi there! I'm Hoang-Chau Nguyen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate tech enthusiast and lifelong learner. My primary interests lie in the exciting domains of web development, data science, and AI. I'm constantly driven to explore new technologies and push the boundaries of innovation. Currently, I am pursuing my studies at Paris Junior College, where I am honing my skills and knowledge in these fields.

In addition to my studies, I have hands-on experience in writing scripts for CAD/CAM in the realm of jewelry design. I've enjoyed creating automation solutions and optimizing workflows for jewelry manufacturing using Rhino 7. It's fascinating to combine my passion for technology with the intricacies of jewelry creation.

While I may not have extensive project experience at the moment, I am eager to collaborate and contribute to projects that intersect the worlds of technology and jewelry design. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and I'm excited to make a meaningful impact in the tech and jewelry communities.

Let's connect and embark on an incredible journey of learning, innovation, and creating stunning jewelry pieces together!
